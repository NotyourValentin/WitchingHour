        <p>You try to rush out of the room, but you run into an invisible wall. You fall backwards and look at Tom, he's crying, and you can see the horror in his eyes. You stand up, and pressed against the invisible barrier you look up in the opposite direction and there it is, a terrifying female figure, covered in blood with extremely long limbs, long straight black hair that covers half of its face and sharp teeth, it appears to be chewing on something. Your eyes can't believe it; it's a witch!</p>
