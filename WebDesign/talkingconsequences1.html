        <p>The witch turns her head creepily to look at you, you can see the anger in her eyes as she says in a demonic female voice: I'm saving you as desert.</p>
        <p>She stands in front of the door, and you can see her a bit more clearly; her fingers are long and sharp like daggers, while looking at her hands you realize what she was chewing onâ€¦ a heart. Your worst fear has been confirmed. She killed Zoe.</p> 
        <p>Everyone starts crying and screaming in panic and fear, there's nothing anyone can do against her and even less so, you who are children. You have to watch her finish eating the heart she is holding in a bite, lift Tom by his neck, and open her mouth wide to her ears. Something that looks like Tom's soul starts leaving his body. She's eating his soul, and you can see the light fading from his eyes. She throws Tom's lifeless body to the side and steps into the room.</p>
