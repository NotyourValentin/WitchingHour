        <p>Zoe peeks into the hallway and tries to figure out what the noise is. She then gets a text from her grandma that says: I figured you'd still be awake, I'm here to check on you. Is your friend okay? I can hear her groaning in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Zoe is relieved with the text and tells you and the others that her grandma is downstairs. You can hear Zoe's grandma knocking on the bathroom door and saying: Honey, are you okay? Do you want me to take you home?</p>
