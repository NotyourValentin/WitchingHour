        <p>You throw every stuffed toy you can find at the witch, she seems unbothered, but you can see her glance at you and smirk wickedly.</p>
        <p>Your efforts to catch her attention have been in vain. Everyone starts crying and screaming in panic and fear, there's nothing anyone can do against her and even less so, you who are children. You have to watch her finish eating the heart she is holding in a bite, lift Tom by his neck, and open her mouth wide to her ears. Something that looks like Tom's soul starts leaving his body. She's eating his soul, and you can see the light fading from his eyes. She throws Tom's lifeless body to the side and steps into the room.</p>
